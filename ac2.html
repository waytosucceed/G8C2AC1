    Theme/ What the Author wanted to convey through the story
  </h1>
  
    <div class="content container"style="background-color:'white'; border: 2px solid lightblue; border-radius:20px; padding:10px" >
  <p style="font-size:18px;text-align: left;">The passage portrays a scene of intense heat and
    drought, where the characters, particularly Garnet and
    her family, are struggling to cope with the harsh
    conditions. Through the vivid descriptions of the
    scorching weather, the parched landscape, and the futile
    anticipation of rain, the author conveys themes of
    resilience, frustration, and the resilience of the human
    spirit in the face of adversity. <br> <br>
  
  
  
  
    Garnet's repeated frustration with the unrelenting heat
    and her desperate plea for rain symbolize humanity's
    struggle against forces beyond its control. Despite her
    anger and despair, Garnet continues with her daily tasks,
    demonstrating resilience and determination in the face of
    hardship. Similarly, her father's resignation to the reality
    of the situation reflects the acceptance of circumstances
    that cannot be changed. 
    <br> <br>

    The author also highlights the importance of family and
    community support during difficult times. Garnet's
    interaction with her mother and brother, as well as her
    routine tasks like setting the table and fetching water,
    emphasize the bonds of love and responsibility that hold
    the family together despite the challenges they face. 
    <br> <br>

    Overall, the passage serves as a reminder of the
    resilience of the human spirit, the importance of
    perseverance in the face of adversity, and the enduring
    power of family and community support. It encourages
    readers to find strength and solace in their connections
    with others, even in the most trying of circumstances. <br>
